WHAT MAKES A DEGREE WORTHLESS?

Baby boomers and hippies might deny the existence of “worthless” college degrees; because their English degree paid off back in the 1970’s, or because you should “follow your heart, for you won’t be good at what you don’t love!”

In the 1960’s about 10-15 percent of the workforce had college degrees. Today, that number hovers at around 40 percent, and in the United States we have had a decade of virtually no economic growth. That entry-level job that allowed the English major to enter the white-collar workforce in 1970 doesn’t exist anymore.

A college degree is worthless if nobody is willing to pay you for the skills you acquired while earning it. STEM graduates, as well as those from Accounting programs, learned actual skills in their studies. Humanities majors learned only “soft skills” like writing, and “critical thinking.” All useless majors teach the same “soft skills.” Many of the useful majors also teach them, so why not choose a useful major?

Almost all kids who are chasing their dumb dreams in college would be better served by majoring in Accounting or IT while working part-time in whatever field they’re planning on pursuing. They’ll have both useful skills and work experience.
