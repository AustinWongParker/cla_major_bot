WHAT DOES A USELESS MAJOR LOOK LIKE?

1. It is all soft skills.

If the department only discusses the great instruction in cognitive ability, critical thinking skills, writing, and analysis and is without reference to any hard skills like running a computer, keeping the books, or designing a satellite; it is probably a worthless major.

2. It prepares you for graduate studies.

I was a Political Science major. It is a terrible major. It prepares you for law school, which is a graduate program that churns out about 3 graduates per available job in that field. That is all Poli-sci does. The ultimate soft skill is preparation for more school.

3. It contains absolutely no math

Mathematics is the language of the universe. Deal with it. Any major that has no arithmetic at all is likely to be a massive waste of time. It doesn’t have to be calculus, but if you hardly ever add, subtract, divide, or multiply, your major is worthless.

4. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data on the field are terrible.

If there are no jobs in the field, or the starting salaries are lower than the median salaries of jobs that don’t require a college degree, your major is a waste of time.
