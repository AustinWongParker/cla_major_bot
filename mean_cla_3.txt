5. The course matter are conspiracy theories.

Things like Gender Studies, Post-colonialism Studies, Sociology, and the like are dripping with post-modernist, Marxist Critical Theory nonsense… Perpetrators, Victims, Patriarchy, Oppression everywhere, taught in an “intersectional framework.”

Some colleges (Macalester, Occidental) actually have a major in Critical Theory. The big, bad Patriarchal, colonialist, imperialist, capitalist, white male power structure is oppressing Humanities students. These are the collegiate equivalent of conspiracy theorists on AM radio who’ve “seen behind the veil of society and know the truth of the all-powerful Illuminati"…. Down the rabbit hole you’ll go. Graduates of these sorts of programs will be oppressed by serious underemployment as they try to build careers as professional left-wing political agitators.



6. You’re planning to teach it to other college students.

Majoring in Anthropology, to go to grad school for Anthropology, so you can become a Teaching Assistant in the Anthropology department, teaching Anthropology to Anthropology majors… as Sterling Archer put it, “thus continuing the circle of Why Bother?!” Ignoring this could be condemning yourself to a long sentence as a transient adjunct professor, since colleges churn out too many PhD's.

7. It’s all for helping people, but it doesn’t.

Sociology majors like to pretend that they’re going to have a career in the non-profit sector where they will help people; usually by nagging people. Somehow, that‘s helpful. They end up working as part-time HR Generalists who reject job applicants for “not being a good fit.” People with Nursing degrees help people by being nurses. Kindergarten teachers, and pharmacy techs also help people… by helping people.
