Why study the liberal arts and sciences?
What is a liberal arts and sciences education, anyway?
The liberal arts and sciences have been the foundation of college education for centuries, and are more important and useful today than ever before.

Rather than a narrow program with a single focus, a liberal arts and sciences education includes lots of possible subjects and areas of study. You can explore and study the arts, humanities, hard sciences, social sciences, languages, environmental sciences, health professions, writing, computers, and math. You'll be exposed to the ideas and cultures of people from across Iowa to around the world, from ancient times to today. And you can combine your interests and" 'talents into an education unique to you.

The liberal arts and sciences teach what today's employers say they value most: how to communicate your ideas; find and analyze information and data; adapt to new technology and professional trends; work with others to solve problems; and make confident, knowledgeable decisions.

A liberal arts and sciences education does more than teach you the skills you need for a successful career - it provides you with the experiences and understanding you need for a fulfilling life.
